# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background
Steve just graduated with his finance degree,his parents wanted to invest in Green Energy. Without doing lots of research, they were going to put all the money in a company call Daqo. Steven is going to look into the stock for his parents, but he's concerned about diversifying their funds. He wants to analyst a handful Green EnergyStocks in additions. He created an Excel with all the information.

So we created a code with VBA to automate analyses allows Streve to reuse it with any stock, and reduces the chance of accidents and errors.I'll refactor, the code to loop through all the data one time in order to make the VBA script run faster.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Since we figured out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.As we see when the Goal is over $10,000, the successful percentage is below 60%. 
The things we need top focus on is when to lunch the canpaign and how long it will last. How we can use the data to make sure Louise will get her goal funds.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
